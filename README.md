# Consumer Preference Analysis for Apparel Brands in Malaysia

This project investigates consumer preferences and decision-making processes among Malaysian buyers, focusing on the choice between three popular apparel brands: **H&M**, **Uniqlo**, and **Brand Outlet**.

## Project Overview
The study combines qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze factors affecting consumer decisions, including:
- **Price**
- **Perceived Quality**
- **Style Preferences**
- **Brand Image**

A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** predictive model is developed to forecast consumer choices based on these factors.

## Data Collection
Surveys are used to gather data from Malaysian consumers, taking into account demographics like **age**, **gender**, and **income**. This data provides insights into consumer behavior and supports the development of marketing strategies.

## Results
The project focuses on user preferences in clothing brands, specifically H&M, Uniqlo, and Brand Outlet. Using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm with **K-Fold cross-validation**, the model achieved:
- An average **accuracy of 98.05%** during the training phase.
- A high accuracy of **95.8% on the testing dataset**.

These results highlight the KNN model's ability to effectively identify patterns within user preferences for clothing brands. The model generalizes well to new, unseen data, offering valuable insights into consumer choices in the fashion sector. The high accuracy rates underscore the robustness of the model, enhancing predictive capabilities for understanding user preferences in the clothing industry.

## Goals
- **Understand consumer preferences** in the Malaysian retail market.
- **Develop predictive models** for brand selection.
- **Provide insights** for better marketing strategies.

This research provides valuable information for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and enhance brand appeal in a competitive market.
